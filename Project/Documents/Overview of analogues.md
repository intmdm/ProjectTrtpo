ATracker is a time tracking application which is very easy to use and requires minimal setup.

It only needs a name and/or icon to setup a unique task, with advanced settings as optional. So you can focus on own work instead of wasting time on mastering the app.

ATracker creates beautiful reports in pie chart and bar chart which you can share via Facebook, Twitter and email. You can also export data in CSV format.
ATracker renders the daily time spending in both list and calendar view. You can tap the task entry to modify it or to convert iCal entry to ATracker entry. You can also compare the iCal planned activity with actual time usage.
